### Project Description
This project is made to make the life of college a student a bit more easy.Aims to streamline and enhance the process of ordering food in cafeteria of a college or any other institutions.its objective is to minimise time in the queue.

### The Problem statement
Almost in every canteens and cafeteria  there is a long queue to order the food and it wastes so much of time.Our objective was to solve this problem.

### The Solution
The solution we used here is purely inspired from the idea module provided by the tinkerhub.As beginers we have done the best that we could.We had planned the project very hvastly with our ideas but we are  unaware of back end development as first years.In this we have planned to create  a automated canteen set up which we can pre order food.There is option for the payment in two ways both the upi and cash on take away.We can solve it more efficiently by adding the option of bill splitting as we all go to canteen by a group other than that of individual.There was also an idea to create a monthly subscription for regular customers.These would have made our project more efficient.A wallet system will be very interesting and it will prompt everyone to use this application.Sice we are beginners this is the best we could do without thw backends.
